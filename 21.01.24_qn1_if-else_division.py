# 1)	Question 
# Task
# Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
# •	If  is odd, print Weird
# •	If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
# •	If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
# •	If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
# Input Format
# A single line containing a positive integer, .
# Constraints
# •	
# Output Format
# Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.
# Sample Input 0
# 3
# Sample Output 0
# Weird
# Explanation 0

#  is odd and odd numbers are weird, so print Weird.
# Sample Input 1
# 24
# Sample Output 1
# Not Weird

# 2) question

# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.
# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .
# No rounding or formatting is necessary.
# Example


# •	The result of the integer division .
# •	The result of the float division is .
# Print:
# 0
# 0.6
# Input Format
# The first line contains the first integer, .
# The second line contains the second integer, .
# Output Format
# Print the two lines as described above.
# Sample Input 0
# 4
# 3
# Sample Output 0
# 1
# 1.33333333333

# solution :

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a//b)
    print(a/b)
